    "\n",
    "The **whole** figure.  The figure keeps\n",
    "track of all the child :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, a smattering of\n",
    "'special' artists (titles, figure legends, etc), and the **canvas**.\n",
    "(Don't worry too much about the canvas, it is crucial as it is the\n",
    "object that actually does the drawing to get you your plot, but as the\n",
    "user it is more-or-less invisible to you).  A figure can contain any\n",
    "number of :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`, but will typically have\n",
    "at least one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to create a new figure is with pyplot::\n",
    "\n",
    "   fig = plt.figure()  # an empty figure with no Axes\n",
    "   fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # a figure with a single Axes\n",
    "   fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)  # a figure with a 2x2 grid of Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "It's convenient to create the axes together with the figure, but you can\n",
    "also add axes later on, allowing for more complex axes layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what you think of as 'a plot', it is the region of the image\n",
    "with the data space. A given figure\n",
    "can contain many Axes, but a given :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`\n",
    "object can only be in one :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`.  The\n",

    "## Types of inputs to plotting functions\n",
    "\n",
    "All of plotting functions expect `numpy.array` or `numpy.ma.masked_array` as\n",
    "input.  Classes that are 'array-like' such as `pandas` data objects\n",
    "and `numpy.matrix` may or may not work as intended.  It is best to\n",

    "### What is a backend?\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of documentation on the website and in the mailing lists refers\n",
    "to the \"backend\" and many new users are confused by this term.\n",
    "Matplotlib targets many different use cases and output formats.  Some\n",
    "people use Matplotlib interactively from the python shell and have\n",
    "plotting windows pop up when they type commands.  Some people run\n",
    "`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ notebooks and draw inline plots for\n",
    "quick data analysis. Others embed Matplotlib into graphical user\n",

    "people use Matplotlib in batch scripts to generate postscript images\n",
    "from numerical simulations, and still others run web application\n",
    "servers to dynamically serve up graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support all of these use cases, Matplotlib can target different\n",
    "outputs, and each of these capabilities is called a backend; the\n",
    "\"frontend\" is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the\n",
    "\"backend\" does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure.\n",
    "There are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in\n",
    "PyQt/PySide, PyGObject, Tkinter, wxPython, or macOS/Cocoa); also referred to\n",
    "as \"interactive backends\") and hardcopy backends to make image files\n",
    "(PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as \"non-interactive backends\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting a backend\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to configure your backend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The :rc:`backend` parameter in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file\n",
    "2. The :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment variable\n",
    "3. The function :func:`matplotlib.use`\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed description is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple of these are configurations are present, the last one from the\n",
    "list takes precedence; e.g. calling :func:`matplotlib.use()` will override\n",
    "the setting in your :file:`matplotlibrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no backend is explicitly set, Matplotlib automatically detects a usable\n",
    "backend based on what is available on your system and on whether a GUI event\n",
    "loop is already running. On Linux, if the environment variable\n",
    ":envvar:`DISPLAY` is unset, the \"event loop\" is identified as \"headless\",\n",
    "which causes a fallback to a noninteractive backend (agg); in all other\n",
    "cases, an interactive backend is preferred (usually, at least tkagg will be\n",
    "available).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed description of the configuration methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Setting :rc:`backend` in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file::\n",
    "\n",
    "       backend : qt5agg   # use pyqt5 with antigrain (agg) rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "   See also :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#. Setting the :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can set the environment variable either for your current shell or for\n",
    "   a single script.\n",
    "\n",
    "   On Unix::\n",
    "\n",
    "        > export MPLBACKEND=qt5agg\n",
    "        > python simple_plot.py\n",
    "\n",
    "        > MPLBACKEND=qt5agg python simple_plot.py\n",
    "\n",
    "   On Windows, only the former is possible::\n",
    "\n",
    "        > set MPLBACKEND=qt5agg\n",
    "        > python simple_plot.py\n",
    "\n",
    "   Setting this environment variable will override the ``backend`` parameter\n",
    "   in *any* :file:`matplotlibrc`, even if there is a :file:`matplotlibrc` in\n",
    "   your current working directory. Therefore, setting :envvar:`MPLBACKEND`\n",
    "   globally, e.g. in your :file:`.bashrc` or :file:`.profile`, is discouraged\n",
    "   as it might lead to counter-intuitive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#. If your script depends on a specific backend you can use the function\n",
    "   :func:`matplotlib.use`::\n",
    "\n",
    "      import matplotlib\n",
    "      matplotlib.use('qt5agg')\n",
    "\n",
    "   This should be done before any figure is created, otherwise Matplotlib may\n",
    "   fail to switch the backend and raise an ImportError.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using `~matplotlib.use` will require changes in your code if users want to\n",

    "   `~matplotlib.use` unless absolutely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The builtin backends\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Matplotlib should automatically select a default backend which\n",
    "allows both interactive work and plotting from scripts, with output to the\n",
    "screen and/or to a file, so at least initially, you will not need to worry\n",
    "about the backend.  The most common exception is if your Python distribution\n",
    "comes without :mod:`tkinter` and you have no other GUI toolkit installed.\n",
    "This happens on certain Linux distributions, where you need to install a\n",
    "Linux package named ``python-tk`` (or similar).\n",

    "better understanding of what is going on, read on. To make things a little\n",
    "more customizable for graphical user interfaces, Matplotlib separates\n",
    "the concept of the renderer (the thing that actually does the drawing)\n",

    "renderer for user interfaces is ``Agg`` which uses the `Anti-Grain\n",

    "\n",
    "#### How do I select PyQt4 or PySide?\n",
    "\n",
    "The :envvar:`QT_API` environment variable can be set to either ``pyqt`` or\n",
    "``pyside`` to use ``PyQt4`` or ``PySide``, respectively.\n",

    "first tries to import it. If the import fails, it tries to import ``PySide``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using non-builtin backends\n",
    "More generally, any importable backend can be selected by using any of the\n",
    "methods above. If ``name.of.the.backend`` is the module containing the\n",
    "backend, use ``module://name.of.the.backend`` as the backend name, e.g.\n",

    "to the screen.  Whether and when plotting to the screen occurs,\n",
    "and whether a script or shell session continues after a plot\n",
    "is drawn on the screen, depends on the functions and methods\n",
    "that are called, and on a state variable that determines whether\n",
    "Matplotlib is in \"interactive mode\".  The default Boolean value is set\n",
    "by the :file:`matplotlibrc` file, and may be customized like any other\n",
    "configuration parameter (see :doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing`).  It\n",
    "may also be set via :func:`matplotlib.interactive`, and its\n",
    "value may be queried via :func:`matplotlib.is_interactive`.  Turning\n",
    "interactive mode on and off in the middle of a stream of plotting\n",
    "commands, whether in a script or in a shell, is rarely needed\n",
    "and potentially confusing. In the following, we will assume all\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive example\n",
    "\n",
    "From an ordinary python prompt, or after invoking ipython with no options,\n",
    "try this::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    plt.ion()\n",
    "    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n",
    "\n",
    "This will pop up a plot window. Your terminal prompt will remain active, so\n",
    "that you can type additional commands such as::\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.title(\"interactive test\")\n",
    "    plt.xlabel(\"index\")\n",
    "\n",
    "On most interactive backends, the figure window will also be updated if you\n",
    "change it via the object-oriented interface. E.g. get a reference to the\n",
    "`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance, and call a method of that instance::\n",
    "\n",
    "    ax = plt.gca()\n",
    "    ax.plot([3.1, 2.2])\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using certain backends (like ``macosx``), or an older version\n",
    "of Matplotlib, you may not see the new line added to the plot immediately.\n",
    "In this case, you need to explicitly call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`\n",
    "in order to update the plot::\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.draw()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-interactive example\n",
    "\n",
    "Start a fresh session as in the previous example, but now\n",
    "turn interactive mode off::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    plt.ioff()\n",
    "    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing happened--or at least nothing has shown up on the\n",
    "screen (unless you are using *macosx* backend, which is\n",
    "anomalous).  To make the plot appear, you need to do this::\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you see the plot, but your terminal command line is\n",
    "unresponsive; `.pyplot.show()` *blocks* the input\n",
    "of additional commands until you manually kill the plot\n",
    "window.\n",
    "\n",
    "What good is this--being forced to use a blocking function?\n",
    "Suppose you need a script that plots the contents of a file\n",
    "to the screen.  You want to look at that plot, and then end\n",
    "the script.  Without some blocking command such as ``show()``, the\n",
    "script would flash up the plot and then end immediately,\n",
    "leaving nothing on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, non-interactive mode delays all drawing until\n",
    "``show()`` is called; this is more efficient than redrawing\n",
    "the plot each time a line in the script adds a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to version 1.0, ``show()`` generally could not be called\n",
    "more than once in a single script (although sometimes one\n",
    "could get away with it); for version 1.0.1 and above, this\n",
    "restriction is lifted, so one can write a script like this::\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "    plt.ioff()\n",
    "    for i in range(3):\n",
    "        plt.plot(np.random.rand(10))\n",
    "        plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes three plots, one at a time. I.e., the second plot will show up\n",
    "once the first plot is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode, pyplot functions automatically draw\n",
    "to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "When plotting interactively, if using\n",
    "object method calls in addition to pyplot functions, then\n",
    "call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw` whenever you want to\n",
    "refresh the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use non-interactive mode in scripts in which you want to\n",
    "generate one or more figures and display them before ending\n",
    "or generating a new set of figures.  In that case, use\n",
    ":func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show` to display the figure(s) and\n",
    "to block execution until you have manually destroyed them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether exploring data in interactive mode or programmatically\n",
    "saving lots of plots, rendering performance can be a painful\n",
    "bottleneck in your pipeline. Matplotlib provides a couple\n",
    "ways to greatly reduce rendering time at the cost of a slight\n",
    "change (to a settable tolerance) in your plot's appearance.\n",
    "The methods available to reduce rendering time depend on the\n",
    "type of plot that is being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Line segment simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "For plots that have line segments (e.g. typical line plots, outlines\n",
    "of polygons, etc.), rendering performance can be controlled by\n",
    ":rc:`path.simplify` and :rc:`path.simplify_threshold`, which\n",
    "can be defined e.g. in the :file:`matplotlibrc` file (see\n",
    ":doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for more information about\n",
    "the :file:`matplotlibrc` file). :rc:`path.simplify` is a boolean\n",
    "indicating whether or not line segments are simplified at all.\n",
    ":rc:`path.simplify_threshold` controls how much line segments are simplified;\n",
    "higher thresholds result in quicker rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script will first display the data without any\n",
    "simplification, and then display the same data with simplification.\n",
    "Try interacting with both of them::\n",
    "\n",
    "  import numpy as np\n",
    "  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "  import matplotlib as mpl\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Setup, and create the data to plot\n",
    "  y = np.random.rand(100000)\n",
    "  y[50000:] *= 2\n",
    "  y[np.geomspace(10, 50000, 400).astype(int)] = -1\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify'] = True\n",
    "\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 0.0\n",
    "  plt.plot(y)\n",
    "  plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 1.0\n",
    "  plt.plot(y)\n",
    "  plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib currently defaults to a conservative simplification\n",
    "threshold of ``1/9``. If you want to change your default settings\n",
    "to use a different value, you can change your :file:`matplotlibrc`\n",
    "file.  Alternatively, you could create a new style for\n",
    "interactive plotting (with maximal simplification) and another\n",
    "style for publication quality plotting (with minimal\n",
    "simplification) and activate them as necessary. See\n",
    ":doc:`/tutorials/introductory/customizing` for\n",
    "instructions on how to perform these actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplification works by iteratively merging line segments\n",
    "into a single vector until the next line segment's perpendicular\n",
    "distance to the vector (measured in display-coordinate space)\n",
    "is greater than the ``path.simplify_threshold`` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Changes related to how line segments are simplified were made\n",
    "  in version 2.1. Rendering time will still be improved by these\n",
    "  parameters prior to 2.1, but rendering time for some kinds of\n",
    "  data will be vastly improved in versions 2.1 and greater.</p></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marker simplification\n",
    "\n",
    "Markers can also be simplified, albeit less robustly than\n",
    "line segments. Marker simplification is only available\n",
    "to :class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` objects (through the\n",
    "``markevery`` property). Wherever\n",
    ":class:`~matplotlib.lines.Line2D` construction parameters\n",
    "are passed through, such as\n",
    ":func:`matplotlib.pyplot.plot` and\n",
    ":meth:`matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot`, the ``markevery``\n",
    "parameter can be used::\n",
    "\n",
    "  plt.plot(x, y, markevery=10)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``markevery`` argument allows for naive subsampling, or an\n",
    "attempt at evenly spaced (along the *x* axis) sampling. See the\n",
    ":doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/markevery_demo`\n",
    "for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Splitting lines into smaller chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the Agg backend (see `what-is-a-backend`),\n",
    "then you can make use of :rc:`agg.path.chunksize`\n",
    "This allows you to specify a chunk size, and any lines with\n",
    "greater than that many vertices will be split into multiple\n",
    "lines, each of which has no more than ``agg.path.chunksize``\n",
    "many vertices. (Unless ``agg.path.chunksize`` is zero, in\n",
    "which case there is no chunking.) For some kind of data,\n",
    "chunking the line up into reasonable sizes can greatly\n",
    "decrease rendering time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following script will first display the data without any\n",
    "chunk size restriction, and then display the same data with\n",
    "a chunk size of 10,000. The difference can best be seen when\n",
    "the figures are large, try maximizing the GUI and then\n",
    "interacting with them::\n",
    "\n",
    "  import numpy as np\n",
    "  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "  import matplotlib as mpl\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify_threshold'] = 1.0\n",

    "  # Setup, and create the data to plot\n",
    "  y = np.random.rand(100000)\n",
    "  y[50000:] *= 2\n",
    "  y[np.geomspace(10, 50000, 400).astype(int)] = -1\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['path.simplify'] = True\n",
    "\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 0\n",
    "  plt.plot(y)\n",
    "  plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "  mpl.rcParams['agg.path.chunksize'] = 10000\n",
    "  plt.plot(y)\n",
    "  plt.show()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Legends\n",
    "\n",
    "The default legend behavior for axes attempts to find the location\n",
    "that covers the fewest data points (``loc='best'``). This can be a\n",
    "very expensive computation if there are lots of data points. In\n",
    "this case, you may want to provide a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the *fast* style\n",
    "\n",
    "The *fast* style can be used to automatically set\n",
    "simplification and chunking parameters to reasonable\n",
    "\n",
    "settings to speed up plotting large amounts of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is very lightweight, so it plays nicely with other\n",
